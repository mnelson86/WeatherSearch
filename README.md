## Further Development
React pre-filled calls to its default image (the spinning React Logo) were not completely removed. Therefore on opening the console, error messages appear that the images cannot be downloaded as they are no longer used in the final app and were removed. Future updates should remove the code that attempts to reach these so that the errors are removed.
